*Clarity in the current fast-paced mess of Open Source innovation {cite}`prem_stateofosai`*

As a data scientist/ML engineer/developer with a 9 to 5 job, it's difficult to keep track of all the innovations. There's been enormous progress in the field in {term}`the last year <SotA>`.

Cure your FOMO with this guide, covering all the most important categories in the Open Source AI space, from model evaluations to deployment. It includes a [](#glossary) for you to quickly check definitions of new frameworks & tools.

A quick TL;DR overview is included at the top of each section. We outline the pros/cons and general context/background for each topic. Then we dive a bit deeper. Examples include data models were trained on, and deployment implementations.

## Who is This Guide For?

```{admonition} Prerequisites to Reading
:class: warning
You should already know the basic principles of MLOps {cite}`google-mlops,redhat-mlops,ml-ops`, i.e. you should know that the traditional steps are:

1. Data engineering (preprocessing, curation, labelling, sanitisation)
2. Model engineering (training, architecture design)
3. Automated testing (CI)
4. Deployment/Automated Inference (CD)
5. Monitoring (logging, feedback, drift detection)
```

You haven't followed the most recent developments in open source AI over {term}`the last year <SotA>`, and want to catch up quickly.
We go beyond just mentioning the models, but also include things such as changing infrastructure, licence pitfalls, and novel applications.

### Editing the Book

- Using {{ '[GitHub Codespaces](https://codespaces.new/{})'.format(
  '/'.join(env.config.html_theme_options.repository_url.split('/')[-2:])) }}, you can edit code & preview the site in your browser without installing anything (you may [have to whitelist `github.dev`, `visualstudio.com`, `github.com`, & `trafficmanager.net`](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/the-githubdev-web-based-editor#using-githubdev-behind-a-firewall) if you use an adblocker).
- Alternatively, to run locally, open {{ '[this repository]({})'.format(env.config.html_theme_options.repository_url) }} in a [Dev Container](https://containers.dev) (most likely [using VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers#_installation)).
- Or instead, manually set up your own Python environment:

  ```sh
  pip install -r requirements.txt              # setup
  jupyter-book build --builder dirhtml --all . # build
  python -m http.server -d _build/dirhtml      # serve
  ```

  ````{admonition} alternative: live rebuilding & serving (experimental)
  :class: tip, dropdown
  ```sh
  pip install -r requirements.txt sphinx-autobuild # setup
  jupyter-book config sphinx .                     # config
  sphinx-autobuild -b dirhtml . _build/dirhtml     # build-serve
  ```
  ````

### Formatting

```{note}
Don't worry about making it perfect, it's fine to open a ([draft](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests#draft-pull-requests)) PR and [allow edits from maintainers](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork) to fix it â™¥

## Conclusion

```{epigraph}
All models are wrong, but some are useful

-- G.E.P. Box {cite}`box-models`
```

% TODO: rewrite

Open Source AI represents the future of privacy and ownership of data. On the other hand, in order to make this happen a lot of innovation should come into place. In the last year, already the open-source community demonstrated how motivated they are in order to deliver quality models to the hands of consumers creating already few big innovations in different AI fields. At the same time, this is just the beginning. Many improvements in multiple directions must be made in order to compare the results with centralised solutions.

At Prem we are on a journey to make this possible, with a focus on developer experience and deployment for any sort of developers, from Web Developers with zero knowledge about AI to affirmed Data Scientist who wants to quickly deploy and try these new models and technologies in their existing infra without compromising privacy.

MoE
  [Mixture-of-Experts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixture_of_experts) is a technique which uses one or more specialist model(s) from a collection of models ("experts") to solve general problems. Note that this is different from [ensemble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ensemble_learning) models (which combine results from all models).

Open
  Ambiguous term that could mean "open source" or "open licence". See [](open).

Permissive
  A type of [open licence](open-licences) which allows reselling and closed-source modifications, and can often be used in larger projects alongside other licences. Usually, the only condition of use is citing the author by name.

Perplexity
  [Perplexity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perplexity) is a metric based on [entropy](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_(information_theory)>), and is a rough measure of the difficulty/uncertainty in a prediction problem.

SotA
  State of the art: recent developments (under 1 year old).

Supervised Fine-tuning
  [SFT](https://cameronrwolfe.substack.com/p/understanding-and-using-supervised) is often the first step in model {term}`alignment`, and is usually followed by {term}`RLHF`. See [](fine-tuning) and [](unaligned-models).

Quantisation
  [Sacrificing precision](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantization_(signal_processing)>) of model weights (e.g. `uint8` instead of `float32`) in return for lower hardware memory requirements.

Token
  A [token](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/semantic-kernel/prompts/) is a "unit of text" for an {term}`LLM` to process/generate. A single token could represent a few characters or words, depending on the tokenisation method chosen. Tokens are usually {term}`embedded <embedding>`.

Transfer Learning
  [Transfer Learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfer_learning) is a process of leveraging a pre-trained model's learned representations and adapting them to solve a different but related problem, often requiring less data and computation compared to training from scratch.. See also {term}`fine-tuning` and [](fine-tuning).

Transformer
  A [transformer](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformer_(machine_learning_model)>) is a neural network using a parallel multi-head [attention](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention_(machine_learning)>) mechanism. The resultant reduce training time makes it well-suited for use in {term}`LLMs <llm>`.
