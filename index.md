# State of Open Source AI Book - 2023 Edition

{{ '```{badges} %s %s\n```' % (baseurl, env.config.html_theme_options.repository_url) }}

*Clarity in the current fast-paced mess of Open Source innovation.*

As a data scientist/developer with a 9 to 5 job, it's difficult to keep track of all the innovations. There's been enormous progress in the field in {term}`the last year <SotA>`.

The guide covers all the most important categories in the Open Source AI space, from model evaluations to deployment. It includes a [](glossary) for you to quickly check definitions of new frameworks & tools.

A quick TL;DR overview is included at the top of each section. We outline the pros/cons and general context/background for each topic. Then we dive a bit deeper. Examples include data models were trained on, and deployment implementations.

## Who is This Guide For?

```{admonition} Prerequisites to Reading
:class: warning
You should already know the basic principles of MLOps {cite}`google-mlops,redhat-mlops,ml-ops`, i.e. you should know that the traditional steps are:

1. Data engineering (preprocessing, curation, labelling, sanitisation)
2. Model engineering (training, architecture design)
3. Automated testing (CI)
4. Deployment/Automated Inference (CD)
5. Monitoring (logging, feedback, drift detection)
```
% why are we linking to sota for the last year developments. i think we should have a quick tldr of all the stuff that has happened in the last year as a footnote or something like n open source models released, n open source llmops tools x number of investment dollars etc etc... sota isnt much of a value add imo

We created this guide for people who haven't followed the most recent developments in open source AI over {term}`the last year <SotA>`. This is for those who want to catch up quickly without reading 50 random blog posts.

We go beyond just mentioning the models but also include things such as changing infrastructure, licence pitfalls, and novel applications.

### Editing the Book

- Using [GitHub Codespaces](https://codespaces.new/premAI-io/state-of-open-source-ai), you can edit code & preview the site in your browser without installing anything (you may have to whitelist `github.dev` & `visualstudio.com` if you use an adblocker).
- Alternatively, to run locally, open {{ '[this repository]({})'.format(env.config.html_theme_options.repository_url) }} in a [Dev Container](https://containers.dev) (most likely [using VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers#_installation)).
- Or instead, manually set up your own Python environment:

  ```sh
  pip install -r requirements.txt                           # setup
  PYTHONPATH=. jupyter-book build --builder dirhtml --all . # build
  python -m http.server -d _build/dirhtml                   # serve
  ```

  ````{admonition} alternative: live rebuilding & serving (experimental)
  :class: tip, dropdown
  ```sh
  pip install -r requirements.txt sphinx-autobuild # setup
  jupyter-book config sphinx .                     # config
  sphinx-autobuild -b dirhtml . _build/dirhtml     # build-serve
  ```

## Conclusion

> All models are wrong, but some are useful {cite}`box-models`.

% TODO: rewrite

Open Source AI represents the future of privacy and ownership of data. On the other hand, in order to make this happen a lot of innovation should come into place. In the last year, already the open-source community demonstrated how motivated they are in order to deliver quality models to the hands of consumers creating already few big innovations in different AI fields. At the same time, this is just the beginning. Many improvements in multiple directions must be made in order to compare the results with centralised solutions.

At Prem we are on a journey to make this possible, with a focus on developer experience and deployment for any sort of developers, from Web Developers with zero knowledge about AI to affirmed Data Scientist who wants to quickly deploy and try these new models and technologies in their existing infra without compromising privacy.

## Glossary

%TODO: define all these & use them where appropriate

```{glossary}
Alignment
  [Aligned AI models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_alignment) must implement safeguards to be helpful, honest, and harmless {cite}`labellerr-alignment`. See [](unaligned-models).

BEC
  [Business Email Compromise](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/security-101/what-is-business-email-compromise-bec).

Copyleft
  A type of [open licence](open-licences) which insists that derivatives of the IP must have the same licence. Also called "protective" or "reciprocal" {cite}`wiki-copyleft`.

Embedding
  [Embedding](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/semantic-kernel/memories/embeddings) means encoding {term}`tokens <token>` into a numeric vector (i.e. array/list). This can be thought of as an intermediary between machine and human language, and thus helps {term}`LLMs <LLM>` understand human language.

Fair Dealing
  A doctrine in UK & commonwealth law permitting use of {term}`IP` without prior permission under certain conditions (typically research, criticism, reporting, or satire) {cite}`wiki-fair-dealing`. See also {term}`fair use`.

Fair Use
  A doctrine in US law permitting use of {term}`IP` without prior permission (regardless of licence/copyright status) depending on 1) purpose of use, 2) nature of the IP, 3) amount of use, and 4) effect on value {cite}`wiki-fair-use`. See also {term}`fair dealing`.

GPU
  [Graphics Processing Unit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit): hardware originally designed to accelerate computer image processing, but now often repurposed for [embarrassingly parallel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embarrassingly_parallel) computational tasks in machine learning.

IP
  [Intellectual Property](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellectual_property): intangible creations by humans (e.g. code, text, art), typically legally protected from use without permission of the author(s).

LLM
  A [Large Language Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model) is neural network (often a {term}`transformer` containing billions of parameters) designed to perform tasks in natural language via [fine tuning](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fine-tuning_(machine_learning)>) or [prompt engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prompt_engineering).

MLOps
  [Machine Learning Operations](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2020/09/03/what-is-mlops): best practices to run AI using software products & cloud services

Open
  Ambiguous term that could mean "open source" or "open licence". See [](open).

Permissive
  A type of [open licence](open-licences) which allows reselling and closed-source modifications, and can often be used in larger projects alongside other licences. Usually, the only condition of use is citing the author by name.

Public Domain
  "Open" {term}`IP` owned by nobody (often due to the author disclaiming all rights) and thus can be used by anyone without restrictions. Technically a disclaimer/non-licence. See [](open-licences).

RAG
  [Retrieval Augmented Generation](https://www.pinecone.io/learn/retrieval-augmented-generation).

ROME
  The [Rank-One Model Editing algorithm](https://rome.baulab.info) alters a trained model's weights to directly modify "learned" information {cite}`meng2023locating,raunak2022rankone`.

SIMD
  [Single Instruction, Multiple Data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIMD) is a [data-level](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_parallelism) [parallel processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_computer) technique where one computational instruction is applied to multiple data simultaneously.

SotA
  State of the art: recent developments (under 1 year old).

Quantisation
  [Sacrificing precision](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantization_(signal_processing)>) of model weights (e.g. `uint8` instead of `float32`) in return for lower hardware memory requirements.

Token
  A [token](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/semantic-kernel/prompt-engineering/tokens) is a "unit of text" for an {term}`LLM` to process/generate. A single token could represent a few characters or words, depending on the tokenisation method chosen. Tokens are usually {term}`embedded <embedding>`.

Transformer
  A [transformer](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformer_(machine_learning_model)>) is a neural network using a parallel multi-head [attention](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention_(machine_learning)>) mechanism. The resultant reduce training time makes it well-suited for use in {term}`LLMs <llm>`.

Evaluation
Auto-regressive language model
Decoder-style transformer
A100, V100, H100
